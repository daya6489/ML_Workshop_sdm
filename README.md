# Workshop on "Machine learning model developments for classification problems"

## Workshop Day 1
1. Covered general introduction to build ML Model
2. Classification problem use case
3. HR analysitcs Data - Context and content of the data
4. Practical Demo using R
  a) Data Cleaning
  b) Data Pre-processing
  c) Missing Imputations
  d) Exploratory data analysis
  e) Feature Engineering
  f) Feature Selection
  g) Data scaling

Created a master data with all existing and derived features. We derived ~190 additional features after processing and feature engineering.
